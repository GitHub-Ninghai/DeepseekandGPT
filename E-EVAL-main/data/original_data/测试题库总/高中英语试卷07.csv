This fantasy is helping her take first steps towards creativity. Minutes later, when she is playing board games with her brother, she's learning to follow rules and take turns with a partner. Although she isn't aware of it, this will play an important role in her adult life.

""Play in all its rich variety is one of the highest achievements of the human species, "" says Dr. David Whitebread from the University of Cambridge. He's also mindful of the worldwide decline of play."" The opportunities for free play, which I experienced almost every day of my childhood, are becoming increasingly scarce now, "" he says. Outdoor play is restricted by parents' perceptions of risk to do with traffic, as well as their increased wish to protect their children from being the victims of crime, and by their emphasis on ""earlier is better"" which is leading to greater competition in academic learning and schools.

What is the purpose of the first paragraph? 
",To illustrate the benefits of too much spare time.,To describe a kid's peaceful and happy childhood.,To present the importance of a rich variety of play.,To introduce the distinctive functions of different toys.,C,"推理判断题。根据第一段“Six-year-old Alice is building a magical kingdom brick by brick, imagining fairy-tale castles and fire-breathing dragons. This fantasy is helping her take first steps towards creativity. Minutes later, when she is playing board games with her brother, she's learning to follow rules and take turns with a partner. Although she isn't aware of it, this will play an important role in her adult life.”（六岁的爱丽丝正在一砖一瓦地建造一个神奇的王国，想象着童话中的城堡和喷火龙。这种幻想帮助她迈出了创造的第一步。几分钟后，当她和弟弟玩桌游时，她学会了遵守规则，和一个伙伴轮流玩。虽然她没有意识到这一点，但这将在她的成年生活中发挥重要作用。）可知，第一段目的是为了呈现丰富多样的玩耍的重要性。故选C。

1479c25e25bc42e19140210c8f73442e,"Autism is a lifelong disability that affects how people interact with others. While the exact cause of autism is unknown, its development in children has been linked to various factors—including zinc deficiency （锌缺乏）.

According to a paper published in Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience, the researchers demonstrated how zinc shapes synapses （突触） during their early development. ""Autism is associated with variants （变异） of genes involved in the formation and maturation of synapses, "" said Sally Kim, lead author of the study from Stanford University School of Medicine.

The team found that when a brain signal was transferred via a synapse, zinc entered the target neuron （神经元）， where it could combine two proteins, SHANK2 and SHANK3. Those proteins cause changes in the composition and function of the synapse.

The finding that zinc shapes the development of synapses via SHANK proteins suggests that a lack of zinc during development could potentially  damage the function of synapses, which enable brain cells to communicate with one another.

…

It's important to note, however, that at present it isn't possible to make any concrete conclusions or begin recommending that children take zinc supplements.

What do we know about autism according to the passage? 
",It is mainly caused by zinc deficiency.,It is a common mental illness among children.,It is associated with specific variants of genes.,It can be cured with the latest advance in neuroscience.,C,"细节理解题。根据文章第二段中“Autism is associated with variants (变异) of genes involved in the formation and maturation of synapses.(自闭症与参与突触形成和成熟的基因变异有关)”可知，自闭症和基因变异有关。故选C。
